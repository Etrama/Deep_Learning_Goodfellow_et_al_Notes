Few Pointers:
- [ ] A lot of the  Images don't work anymore in Linear Algebra Part 1 and Part 2. I was using MathPix to get the images, didn't know they used a freemium model. Need to update these.
* This also indicates a need to simplify. The equations take a lot of time, to write to in LaTeX without software like MathPix. Let's try our best using code.
